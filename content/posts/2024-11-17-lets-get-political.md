So [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) got elected president of the USA this year [in 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election). I think if you are a rational human being you know this is not a good thing. It doesn't even matter if you're left or right on the political spectrum. Do you really think someone who has been rich their whole life has the interests of the average person in mind? No way.

I voted for [Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris). But that doesn't mean I'm a Kamala fanatic. And that's why I'm not afraid to say I voted for her. I just think she was the best choice. I'm left-leaning but I don't consider myself a [Democrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)).

I think this post is just a way for me to vent my dissilusionment of the USA political system. I've never voted for anyone I feel strongly about. I think most Americans vote against their best interests. I think most people vote based on the [culture war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_war) that's going on even if that doesn't affect their bottom line. In fact, it may even make their lives worse. But hey, if you enjoy putting down people that are [against your beliefs and values](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/anti-lgbtq-rhetoric-plays-prominent-role-first-night-rnc-rcna162028) then maybe it's all worth it.

I hate the political system in the USA. I don't know what to do about it, but it definitely needs to change.

Fuck Donald Trump. Fuck Kamala Harris. I think Trump is worse than Kamala but I would rather have someone else run the country than those two.

I hope the future of the USA is bright regardless.
