I have a growing hatred for AI-generated images in blogs. It makes me wonder if the text in the blog posts is AI-generated to some extent. It's always disappointing seeing these images in blogs run by individuals. I expect this from corporate blogs but not indie blogs.

I'd rather see a shitty [Microsoft Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint) drawing as opposed to some AI image.

I know there's plenty of things you can roast my blog for but at least you know for a fact you're getting the thoughts of a real human being and not some [LLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model).

If you run a personal blog, please avoid AI-generated images.
