I have worked for several companies at this point. Every company has a different mission. It's usually something idealistic or grandiose. However, every company's real mission is **to make money**. Most, if not all, companies are willing to give up their public mission if it is unprofitable.

I wish companies were more honest about this. It's okay to admit that the ultimate mission is to make as much money as possible. It's obvious that companies exist primarily to earn money. I would have more respect for companies that were more honest about this.
