It's possible to install older versions of Homebrew packages by saving an older version of the corresponding Ruby file locally and running `brew install <package>.rb`. I'll use the `terraform` package as an example.

> TL;DR: If I wanted to downgrade to Terraform 1.3.6, I would need to:
> - Find the Ruby file for that specific version of [Terraform on the Homebrew GitHub repo](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/169f333f93fe0703b542cdf75b1decd4cb78f68d/Formula/terraform.rb)
> - Download the Ruby file
> - Uninstall the current version of terraform by running `brew remove terraform`
> - Install the older version defined in the Ruby file by running `brew install terraform.rb`

Let's say we have `terraform` version 1.4.5 but we need `terraform` version 1.3.6. We can start by browsing to https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/tree/master/Formula and try to find the formula for `terraform` under the `t` directory.

Since there are a lot of files here, it's easier to just modify the URL path in the browser. Modify the path based on the directory the command is in: Take the name of the package and append it at the end of the url, adding `/<directory-containing-package>/<package-name>.rb` to the URL. The `.rb` is important because all Homebrew packages are defined in Ruby (files with the `.rb` extension).

In this case, we'll append `/t/terraform.rb` to the URL like so: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/t/terraform.rb

That URL will then take us to the Ruby file where the `terraform` Homebrew package is defined.

Next, click the "History" link on the upper right above the code, or just click on this link https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commits/master/Formula/t/terraform.rb. In the next page, scroll down until you see the "terraform: update 1.3.6 bottle" link. Note that you may need to click on "Browse History" at the bottom of this page before continuing your search.

Click on the [terraform: update 1.3.6 bottle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/169f333f93fe0703b542cdf75b1decd4cb78f68d) link to see this page:

<img src="/how-to-install-older-versions-of-homebrew-packages/commit.webp" alt="Commit for terraform 1.3.6" width="720" height="395" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 3840 / 2110;" loading="lazy" decoding="async">

On the right side above the code block, click on the three dots, then click on "View file".

This will take you to the [package formula for this specific version of terraform](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/169f333f93fe0703b542cdf75b1decd4cb78f68d/Formula/terraform.rb).

<img src="/how-to-install-older-versions-of-homebrew-packages/older-terraform.webp" alt="Formula for terraform 1.3.6" width="720" height="395" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 3840 / 2110;" loading="lazy" decoding="async">

On the upper right side of the code block, click on "Raw". This [gives us the exact code we need](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/169f333f93fe0703b542cdf75b1decd4cb78f68d/Formula/terraform.rb) to install Terraform 1.3.6. Save the code locally to a file called `terraform.rb`. You can manually copy and paste or use `curl`:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/169f333f93fe0703b542cdf75b1decd4cb78f68d/Formula/terraform.rb > terraform.rb
```

Then, remove the existing package:

```
$ brew remove terraform

Uninstalling /usr/local/Cellar/terraform/1.4.5... (6 files, 69MB)
```

Then run `brew install` but specify the file you saved locally to install the older version. Note that as of [Homebrew version 4.6.4](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/tag/4.6.4) you can no longer install formulae directly from a file. You can get around this by specifying [the environment variable](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/20414) `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER`.

So to install Terraform from the file we just downloaded, run `HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=true brew install --formulae terraform.rb`:

```
$ HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=true brew install --formulae terraform.rb

```

Now `terraform` version 1.3.6 is installed!

```
$ terraform version
