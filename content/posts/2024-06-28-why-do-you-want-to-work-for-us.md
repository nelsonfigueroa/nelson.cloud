*"Why do you want to work for us?"*

I have run into this question many times as I've been applying to and interviewing with lots of companies.

99% of the reason people want to work for a company is **because they need money**. That's it. They want to be able to pay off debt. They want to be able to pay their bills. They want to be able to pay rent or their mortgage. They want to be able provide for their family. They want to be able to afford a better life. And so on.

Sure, the tech stack might be exciting. Or the product may be compelling. The work-life balance may be good. But I promise you that the biggest reason is still money.

If you don't believe me, find your most passionate engineers, cut their compensation in half, and see if they stick around. I guarantee you they won't.

Let's stop beating around the bush and be real with each other. Do you really want to to be lied to by every candidate?

It's okay to be motivated by money. That's the world we live in. An engineer can do amazing work for your company even if they are only motivated by money. Also, companies are only motivated by making money. What's wrong with the average person being motivated by the same thing?

You may have come across my application to your company at some point. I may have said something about wanting to work with bright people and looking for growth opportunities. While that is still true, you should know that 99% of the reason I applied to your company is to earn money so I can buy food, pay rent, and provide for my family.

Let's stop asking this question in the application and interview process. We all know the real answer.
