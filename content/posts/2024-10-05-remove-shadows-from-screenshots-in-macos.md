On macOS, screenshots of windows have an added drop shadow by default for whatever reason. Here's how to remove it:

To remove shadows from screenshots copy and paste this into the command line:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.screencapture "disable-shadow" -bool "true"
```

<br>

To reset this setting and have shadows in your screenshots again run this:

```shell
defaults delete com.apple.screencapture "disable-shadow"
```

<br>

Alternatively, you can press `command` + `shift` + `4` and then press `space`. Then hold `option` before you click on a window to take a screenshot. This removes the drop shadow.

There were several other sites covering this but they didn't get right to the point and/or they were ad-ridden, so I decided to write a straightforward post about this.
