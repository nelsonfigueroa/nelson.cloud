I find myself asking this any time I discover that someone uses a web browser with no ad blocking solution. More specifically, it blows my mind when tech-savvy people that work in software development (and related roles) don't use ad blockers. I don't understand why.

The "main" web is a terrible experience when browsing without ad blockers.

If you're one of those people that doesn't have an ad blocker here are some links to improve your web browsing experience.

## Browser Extensions to Block Ads

The best and arguably only ad blocker you'll need for your browser is [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). It has worked consistently for me on Firefox and Chrome for many, many years.

Here are some convenient links to get uBlock Origin:
- [Get the uBlock Origin Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [Get the uBlock Origin Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)
- [Get the uBlock Origin Microsoft Edge extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak) (if you use Edge for some reason)

## For Safari Users

[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) doesn't support extensions like other browsers. While there is some tracking protection out of the box it doesn't compare to uBlock Origin. If you REALLY want to keep using Safari then check out [AdGuard for Mac](https://adguard.com/adguard-mac/overview.html). It blocks ads system-wide on macOS and not just in Safari.

If you like the Safari aesthetic but don't want to install AdGuard, check out [Orion Browser](https://kagi.com/orion/). It comes with ad blocking out of the box. It's based on [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) just like Safari. There's even an iOS app available.

- [Get Orion for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/orion-browser-by-kagi/id1484498200)

## Brave Browser

[Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) is also a great browser if you want an ad-free web experience. It's available on all major platforms (Windows, Android, Linux, macOS, iOS) and it comes with ad blocking built in. I hesitate a bit to recommend Brave because it comes with some optional [crypto bullshit](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) called [Basic Attention Token](https://basicattentiontoken.org/), but you don't have to opt into that.

## Start Browsing the Web with Ad Blockers

There are many options for blocking ads regardless of the device you're using. Start browsing the web with an ad blocker and you'll never go back to browsing the normal ad-infested web.
