This is a list of resources I use to discover new blogs. I also maintain a [list of my favorite blogs]({{< relref "2024-04-03-my-favorite-blogs.md" >}}) if you're interested.

## Hacker News

By far the best way I've discovered new blogs is through Hacker News. I occasionally discover new blogs when a post/article from that blog is submitted to Hacker News. There are also HN posts where people share blogs:
- [Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081)
- [Ask HN: Favorite Blogs by Individuals?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27302195)

There's more posts like these that can be found with a quick Google ssearch.

## Kagi Small Web

**https://kagi.com/smallweb/**

Kagi Small Web is an effort to highlight smaller sites and blogs around the web. You can learn more in [Kagi's announcement post](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web)

A list of all sites indexed by Kagi Small Web is on GitHub: [https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/blob/main/smallweb.txt](https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/blob/main/smallweb.txt)

## indieblog.page

**https://indieblog.page/**

indieblog.page lets you click a button and get a random blog post.

They also have a [list of all blogs](https://indieblog.page/all) and [several RSS feeds](https://indieblog.page/rss) to make discoverability easier.

## theforest.link

**https://theforest.link/**

Very similar to [indieblog.page](https://indieblog.page/) but more minimal. Click a button and get redirected to a random site.

## blogs.hn

**https://blogs.hn/**

This is a collection of blogs that mainly come from Hacker News. It was created by [Taylor Troesh](https://taylor.town/).

## Neocities

**https://neocities.org/**

Neocities is a place where users can create a static site for free. Most sites here are reminiscent of the 90s web. I like to [browse by the latest updated sites](https://neocities.org/browse?sort_by=last_updated) but there are other filters too.

## ooh.directory

**https://ooh.directory/**

ooh.directory is a collection of blogs on all sorts of topics. They have a [Random Blogs](https://ooh.directory/random/) area that works similarly to [indieblog.page](https://indieblog.page/) and [theforest.link](https://theforest.link/).

## personalsit.es

**https://personalsit.es/**

Another collection of blogs -- with previews!

## 250kb.club, 512kb.club, 1mb.club

**https://250kb.club/**

**https://512kb.club**

**https://1mb.club**

These sites all have the same idea in that they are collections of sites that are under a certain size (at least for the home page). There's lots of blogs to discover among all three lists.

## bukmark.club

**https://bukmark.club/directory/**

bukmark.club is a list of sites that have curated links to other sites. You can easily go down a rabbit hole.
