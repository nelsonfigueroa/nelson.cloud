**> "Why do you want to work for our company?"**

Your company has an opening that I believe I am qualified for that also pays more than my current position. I also need money to pay for bills, groceries, rent, and the overall cost of being alive.

**> "Why are you leaving your current company?"**

I found a job opening at your company that pays more than my current role.

**> "What are you looking for in the next role?"**

A big pay bump. Opportunities to become better at software engineering would be cool too.

**> "What excites you about this role?"**

Two things:
1. This position at your company pays more than my current role.
2. There may be more opportunities to grow as a software engineer. But mostly the first reason.

**> "What are your salary expectations?"**

Whatever the maximum of the salary range is for this position.

**> "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**

If the compensation for this position increases year to year and is in line with other top paying companies, I see myself staying at your company. It also helps if there are growth opportunities for me as a software engineer.

Otherwise, I see myself at a different company from yours that pays more.

On a more serious note...

Don't get me wrong, growing as a software engineer is still important to me. I want to work with great people and build cool things. It just sucks that I have to lie during interviews because honesty would get me disqualified. Doing 4+ rounds of interviews is already exhausting enough.
