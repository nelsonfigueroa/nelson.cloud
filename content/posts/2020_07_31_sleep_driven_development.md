I know of Test-Driven Development, where a developer writes tests for new functionality first, then writes the actual code to implement a feature. I have also heard of Resume-Driven Development, where a developer implements new and trendy technologies to complete a task simply to be able to add that technology to their resume. Today, after getting asked to do some work early over the weekend and help with a task after midnight on a Sunday, I came up with Sleep-Driven Development.

The idea behind Sleep-Driven Development is that the software development process should aim to increase sleeping time for everyone. It's about taking into consideration application stability during development and addressing technical debt periodically. If applications at work were more stable, I would not have to work weekends or late nights well beyond my bed time.

A resilient application makes everyone happy. Developers don't have to work late hours or weekends to push hotfixes. Infrastructure engineers don't have to worry about servers going down in the middle of the night. Everyone can sleep in peace. It sounds like common sense, but my personal experience says otherwise.

I have seen many situations where something is broken in a production application and a fix is hastily created and pushed. After the application is stable, everyone focuses on other matters. The application may be stable now, but no one actually knows for sure if the fix is permanent. There is not a lot of investigation into the cause. Everyone is focused on developing the new features that were requested by those on top. The production hiccup is forgotten. Over time, technical debt grows and is not addressed properly.

This process is not very sleep-driven. Down the line, someone will end up losing sleep due to production issues. Developers will find themselves up late pushing a hotfix. Infrastructure engineers end up looking through logs on a weekend to see what went wrong. During leisure activities, everyone is hoping in the back of their minds that everything is stable. No one can sleep in peace out of fear that they might get the dreaded midnight call that an application is down.

I understand that no matter how stable a system is, things eventually go down. Even major companies like Google have outages. But these are rare. I also understand that being on call is normal in the software engineering world. We all eventually end up doing some work on the weekend, although this should also be rare. However, peace of mind and proper sleep is not necessarily normal and depends on the company.

We should all aim to sleep more and live life without worrying about work outside of work hours through sleep-driven development.

But hey, maybe I'm just grumpy that I haven't slept well this week and now my sleep will be ruined over the weekend as well.
