Here are my donations earnings for the past year.

Amazing right??? ðŸ˜‚

In all seriousness, I'm not upset about this at all. I didn't expect to get any donations when I originally added a "donate" link to my site. I just wanted to share my experience so others can see the reality of donations :). I will continue to blog regardless.

It's worth mentioning that my site isn't popular by any means. Here are my metrics from Google Search Console for the past 3 months:

I am curious to see what the donation earnings (if any) are for much more popular blogs and personal sites.
