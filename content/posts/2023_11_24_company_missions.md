I have worked for several companies at this point. Every company has a different mission. 

Honestly, I feel like missions are just cover-ups for a companies real mission: **to make money**.

I think that no matter what, any company's real mission is to make money. Most, if not all, companies are willing to give up their public mission if it is unprofitable.

I just wish companies were more honest about this. It's obvious and it's okay to admit the ultimate mission is just to earn as much money as possible.

I think I would have more respect for companies that just admitted this.
