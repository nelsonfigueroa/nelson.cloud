I randomly checked LinkedIn the other day and I saw this banner at the top of my feed:

<img src="/we-exist-only-to-work/linkedin-banner.webp" alt="Banner on LinkedIn" width="720" height="168" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 1092 / 256;" loading="lazy" decoding="async">

It's obviously an advertisement but it made me think about how much we actually work in our lives. I looked up the average lifespan of a male in the USA and got this:

<img src="/we-exist-only-to-work/life-expectancy.webp" alt="Life expectancy in the USA" width="720" height="281" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 2048 / 800;" loading="lazy" decoding="async">

That's depressing. We work most of our lives. I know that wasn't their intent but yeah.

Fuck.
