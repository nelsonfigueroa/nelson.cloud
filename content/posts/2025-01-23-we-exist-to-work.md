I randomly checked LinkedIn the other day and I saw this banner at the top of my feed:

![Banner on LinkedIn](/we-exist-only-to-work/linkedin-banner.webp)

It's obviously an advertisement but it made me think about how much we actually work in our lives. I looked up the average lifespan of a male in the USA and got this:

![Life expectancy in the USA](/we-exist-only-to-work/life-expectancy.webp)

That's depressing. We work most of our lives. I know that wasn't their intent but yeah.

Fuck.
