[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is pretty cool for static sites. I previously created my personal site using Ruby on Rails. I knew it was overkill but I enjoyed the challenge of setting everything up from scratch. The problem was that I am not good at front-end design and I was never happy with my layouts. Hugo has a lot of themes I can choose from which makes everything very simple. I look forward to using Hugo in the long run.
